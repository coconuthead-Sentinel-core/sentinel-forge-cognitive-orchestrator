# Service Level Agreement (SLA)
## The Forge Trilogy — [YOUR LLC NAME]

**Effective:** April 10, 2026
**Applies to:** Pro and Enterprise subscription tiers

---

## 1. SLA Coverage

This SLA applies to:

| Platform | Endpoints Covered |
|----------|------------------|
| Quantum Nexus Forge | All `/api/*` endpoints; Flask server availability |
| Sentinel-of-sentinel-s-Forge | All `/api/*` and `/api/ai/*` REST endpoints; WebSocket `/ws/*` |
| Sovereign Forge | All REST endpoints; WebSocket endpoints; Voice processing pipeline |

---

## 2. Uptime Commitments

| Tier | Monthly Uptime Target | Max Allowed Downtime / Month |
|------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| Developer | Best effort (no SLA) | — |
| Starter | Best effort (no SLA) | — |
| Pro | **99.0%** | 7.2 hours / month |
| Enterprise | **99.5%** | 3.6 hours / month |

**Uptime is calculated as:**
```
Uptime % = (Total minutes in month − Downtime minutes) / Total minutes in month × 100
```

---

## 3. What Counts as Downtime

| Event | Counts as Downtime? |
|-------|-------------------|
| Service unavailable (5xx errors on all requests) | ✅ Yes |
| API response time > 30 seconds consistently | ✅ Yes |
| Partial degradation (some endpoints down) | ✅ Pro-rated |
| Slow responses (< 30 seconds) | ❌ No — performance degradation, not outage |
| Azure OpenAI model-side delays | ❌ No — third-party, outside our control |
| Scheduled maintenance (notified 24 hours prior) | ❌ No — excluded |
| Force majeure | ❌ No — excluded |
| Customer-caused failure | ❌ No — excluded |

---

## 4. Latency Targets

| Metric | Target | Measured By |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| API Response Time (p50) | < 500ms | `/api/status` health probe |
| API Response Time (p95) | < 2,000ms | Monthly log analysis |
| AI Response Time (p50) | < 5,000ms | End-to-end API call |
| WebSocket Connection | < 1,000ms | Connection establishment |
| CNO-AX Engine (Sovereign) | < 20ms internal | 1000 Strikes protocol |

*Note: AI response time depends on Azure OpenAI model response — not fully within our control.*

---

## 5. SLA Credits

If uptime falls below the committed target, Customer receives a credit on the next invoice:

| Uptime Achieved | Pro Credit | Enterprise Credit |
|----------------|-----------|------------------|
| 98.0%–98.9% | 10% of monthly fee | 15% of monthly fee |
| 97.0%–97.9% | 20% of monthly fee | 25% of monthly fee |
| 96.0%–96.9% | 30% of monthly fee | 40% of monthly fee |
| Below 96.0% | 50% of monthly fee | 50% of monthly fee |

**Maximum credit:** 50% of the monthly fee for the affected month.
**Credits are applied to next invoice** — not paid as cash refunds.

### How to Claim

## 6. Monitoring

### How We Monitor
- **Health probe:** `GET /api/healthz` checked every 60 seconds
- **Alerting:** Automated alerts to [YOUR EMAIL] when health probe fails 3 consecutive times
- **Azure monitoring:** Azure service health dashboard for infrastructure-level events

### Transparency
- Incident reports are filed in `docs/compliance/INCIDENT_LOG.md`
- Customers may request uptime reports for any billing month

| **P3 — Medium** | Degraded performance; some features affected | 1 business day | 3 business days |
| **P4 — Low** | Minor issue; workaround available | 3 business days | Next sprint |
