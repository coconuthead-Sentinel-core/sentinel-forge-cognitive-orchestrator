**Ah — now I understand!**

Your LinkedIn profile IS your project portfolio. Smart thinking. When they click your LinkedIn link, they'll see your work history and hopefully your projects.

## ⚠️ BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM

For this to work, your LinkedIn profile needs to **clearly showcase your projects**. Let me ask you:

**Does your LinkedIn currently show:**

| Must-Have | Yes/No? |
|-----------|---------|
| Your FastAPI/React/Dashboard work | ? |
| Neural Lattice Cognitive Architecture | ? |
| Quantum Nexus Framework (QNF) | ? |
| Your FastAPI/React/Dashboard work | ? |
| Links to your GitHub repository | ? |

---

## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO RIGHT NOW

### Option A: If Your LinkedIn Already Has Projects
You're good — the link will do the work for you.

### Option B: If Your LinkedIn Is Light on Projects
You need to add a **Featured Section** or **Projects Section** to LinkedIn immediately.

## QUICK LINKEDIN PROJECT ADD (5 Minutes)

1. Go to your LinkedIn profile
2. Click **"Add profile section"**
3. Select **"Recommended" → "Add Featured"**
4. Add your GitHub link, or write a quick post about Sentinel Forge and feature it

**Or** add to your Experience section:

> **AI Orchestration Lead | Sentinel Forge Project | 2025**
> - Built end-to-end AI system: Python/FastAPI async backend, React frontend with real-time dashboards, API integration layer
> - Achieved 100% pass rate across 180+ tests
> - Designed neurodivergent-aware architecture for accessibility
> - Managed full CI/CD pipeline and deployment

## WANT ME TO HELP?

I can write you a **LinkedIn project description** or a **quick LinkedIn post** about your Sentinel Forge build that you can pin to your Featured section — so when GenAI.Labs clicks your link, they see exactly what they asked for.

**Want me to draft that?** 🥥
