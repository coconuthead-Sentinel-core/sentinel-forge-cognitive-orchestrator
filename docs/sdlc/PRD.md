# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Sentinel Forge Cognitive AI Orchestration Platform v4.0

**Architect:** Shannon Bryan Kelly
**Implementation:** Claude AI (Anthropic)
**Date:** April 2026
**GitHub:** coconuthead-Sentinel-core/sentinel-forge-cognitive-orchestrator

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Existing AI platforms are passive â€” they wait for input, respond, and stop. They do not monitor their own performance, adapt to the user's cognitive profile, or optimize themselves in real time. For power users, researchers, and neurodivergent thinkers who need an AI system that *learns the shape of their thinking*, existing tools fall short.

---

## 2. Product Vision

**Sentinel Forge Cognitive AI Orchestration Platform** is a self-optimizing, real-time cognitive AI operating system. It does not just respond â€” it continuously monitors its own state, adjusts its processing through a 14-Mirror Cognitive Array, and targets the "Stillwater State" (perfect cognitive flow) through the CNO-AX Metacognition Engine.

It is the most architecturally advanced platform in the Forge trilogy, designed for users who want an AI that adapts *to them* at the system level.

## 3. Target Users

| User | Need |
|------|------|
| AI researchers | Real-time observability into cognitive processing pipelines |
| Neurodivergent knowledge workers | AI that adapts to their cognitive profile persistently |
| Enterprise architects | Scalable FastAPI backend with WebSocket streaming |
| Shannon Bryan Kelly | Portfolio demonstration of advanced AI orchestration |

## 4. Core Features

### 4.1 CNO-AX Metacognition Engine
- Self-monitoring cognitive loop
- "1000 Strikes" optimization protocol targeting Stillwater State
- Achieved: 11.90ms average latency, 3.41ms jitter
- Metrics: Flow Rate, Efficiency (Golden Ratio Ï† target), Congestion

### 4.2 14-Mirror Cognitive Array
- 14 symbolic processing mirrors mapped to Platonic geometry points
- GREEN mirrors (M1,M2,M4,M6): Active glyph synthesis
- YELLOW mirrors (M3,M5,M7,M8): Pattern recognition
- RED mirrors (M9â€“M14): Deep archival, ethical boundaries, core truths

### 4.3 Real-Time WebSocket Streaming
- `/ws/cognitive` â€” combined events + metrics
- `/ws/metrics` â€” performance dashboard (2-second interval)
- `/ws/events` â€” system event notifications
- Client dashboard binds live to all WebSocket endpoints

### 4.4 Voice Interface (TTS/STT)
- Speech-to-text user input routed to `/api/chat`
- AI responses fed through TTS "Karaoke" engine
- Visual highlighting synchronized with speech output

### 4.5 Sigma Network Engine
- Feature-flagged cognitive decision engine
- Driven by persistent Sentinel Profile
- MOUSE Cache Manager for write-through persistence
- Runtime behavior adapts to profile state

### 4.6 Sentinel Profile System
- Persistent user cognitive profile stored via JSONStore
- Drives all feature flags and system behavior
- Profile loaded on startup, updated in real time

### 4.7 Neurodivergent Cognitive Lenses
- ADHD: 50-word chunking, bullet formatting, burst processing
- Autism: Explicit categorization, structure enhancement, pattern recognition
- Dyslexia: Spatial anchors, visual chunking, overview maps
- Neurotypical: Baseline for comparison

### 4.8 Three-Zone Memory with A1 Filing
- GREEN (entropy > 0.7): Active processing
- YELLOW (0.3â€“0.7): Pattern emergence
- RED (< 0.3): Crystallized archival
- Physical A1 Filing directories mirror zone structure

### 4.9 Azure OpenAI Integration
- Model: o4-mini
- Mock fallback for development (`MOCK_AI=true`)
- Azure Cosmos DB persistence layer

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

| Requirement | Target |
|------------|--------|
| API latency | < 20ms (Stillwater State: 11.90ms achieved) |
| WebSocket update interval | 2 seconds |
| Evaluation score | â‰¥ 3.9 / 5.0 |
| Fallback availability | 100% via mock mode |
| Test coverage | Unit + integration + 1000 Strikes protocol |

---

## 6. Out of Scope (Current Version)

- Multi-tenant / multi-user deployment
- Mobile application
- Production cloud hosting
- L7 Singularity visualization (planned, not complete)
- Full WebSocket-to-dashboard wiring (partially complete)

---

## 7. Success Criteria

- âœ… FastAPI backend starts and serves all endpoints
- âœ… WebSocket streams real-time cognitive events
- âœ… CNO-AX Engine runs 1000 Strikes protocol
- âœ… Sentinel Profile persists between sessions
- âœ… All four cognitive lenses return differentiated responses
- âœ… Azure OpenAI o4-mini connected and live
- âœ… Full SDLC and compliance documentation complete
- âœ… CI pipeline passes on every commit
