# HR Review Packet

## Project Snapshot
- Project: Sentinel Forge Cognitive AI Orchestration Platform
- Owner: Shannon Bryan Kelly
- Repository namespace: `coconuthead-Sentinel-core`
- Review branch: `main`
- Review date: 2026-04-22

## What This Repository Demonstrates
- FastAPI application design and API organization
- adaptive formatting through multiple cognitive lenses
- symbolic or glyph-aware event processing
- EventBus-backed WebSocket streaming
- repository-grade engineering paperwork and release discipline

## Review Outcome
The repository is being packaged as a finished technical review release rather than a public cloud launch. For hiring and portfolio review, this means:
- the implementation is locally runnable
- the documentation is complete and coherent
- the code and paperwork agree on scope and exclusions
- the canonical branch is `main`

## Included Review Artifacts
- Root overview: `README.md`
- Architecture summary: `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- API documentation: `docs/API.md`
- Engineering-build suite: `docs/engineering-build/README.md`
- SDLC packet: `docs/sdlc/README.md`
- Production readiness packet: `docs/production/`
- iOS applicability packet: `docs/compliance/ios/README.md`
- Governance, security, and contribution docs: `GOVERNANCE.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

## Scope And Exclusions
Completed in this release:
- implementation cleanup for route and orchestration coherence
- documentation completion
- local validation path
- release packaging on `main`

Excluded from this release:
- Azure secret provisioning and live deployment
- commercial SaaS launch
- iOS product delivery

## Final Validation
The final validation commands, push result, and branch cleanup state are recorded in:
- `docs/sdlc/QA_RELEASE_READINESS.md`
- `docs/production/READY_TO_SHIP_CHECKLIST.md`

Key results for this release:
- `pytest -q tests/test_api_completion.py`: 4 passed
- `python scripts/smoke_test.py`: passed
- `pytest -q`: 156 passed
- OpenAPI export refreshed successfully
- `main` pushed successfully
- all local and remote child branches removed so only `main` remains

## Hiring-Manager Summary
This repository should be read as a finished engineering portfolio piece with:
- real code changes
- real verification steps
- complete active paperwork
- explicit handling of out-of-scope work instead of hidden gaps
